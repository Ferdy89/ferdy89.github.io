      <description>Hello!
My name is Fernando and I code professionally. I have been into computers since I was very young and I&amp;rsquo;ve devoted a big part of my life to it.
I currently work primarily with Ruby and one of the things I love the most about it is its community. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot from watching conference talks and reading on the Internet, and most of that content was created by people in their free time.</description>
