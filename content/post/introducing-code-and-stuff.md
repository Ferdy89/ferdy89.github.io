Hello!

My name is Fernando and I code professionally. I have been into computers since
I was very young and I've devoted a big part of my life to it.

I currently work primarily with Ruby and one of the things I love the most
about it is its community. I've learned a lot from watching conference talks
and reading on the Internet, and most of that content was created by people in
their free time. They might not know this, but I owe them a lot.

Because of this, I feel the need to give back and write about what I know
myself. It might not be a lot, but I sure hope it helps somebody. I would love
to share the passion I feel about programming and my experience. Worst case,
I'll organize my thoughts by writing them down.

Here we go!
