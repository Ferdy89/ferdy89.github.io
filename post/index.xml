      <description>I recently wrote a new library for Ruby called Unique Thread. It allows multiple Ruby processes to communicate through Redis so only one of them is running a given thread concurrently. The idea for this came to me when wanting to run a crontab runner on a Rails app but only wanted one of the processes to be running at any given time. If the process running the thread shuts down, I also wanted another process to wake up and start running in its place.</description>

      <description>Hello!
My name is Fernando and I code professionally. I have been into computers since I was very young and I&amp;rsquo;ve devoted a big part of my life to it.
I currently work primarily with Ruby and one of the things I love the most about it is its community. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot from watching conference talks and reading on the Internet, and most of that content was created by people in their free time.</description>
